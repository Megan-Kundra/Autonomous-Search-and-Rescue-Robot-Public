# Autonomous-Search-and-Rescue-Robot-Public
This application creates an autonomous search and rescue robotic agent, leveraging evolutionary algorithms for machine learning and optimized search routes. This is built around the theory of probabilistic robotics to model uncertainties in the environment.

Specific features include:

pygame for setting up the simulation environment
Evolutionary Algorithms for learned & optimized search behaviors (machine learning integrations)
Kalman Filter implementation for self localization in probabilistic robotics models
Occupancy grid for internal mapping and navigation
Distance sensors for use in the motion model of the robotic agent
Beacon sensors for use in triangulation to accomplish self localization

As this is a private project, please contact me if you would like to see any specific code sections or implementation details.
